Full React/CSS project. No Framework.  

I used my own Font and:
- [Anchor Link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll) for a smooth scrolling anchors
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.netlify.com/#/) for icons
- [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) helped me for fading in and out some contents.
